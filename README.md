# Manipulability_Control

This repository implements the Jacobian-based and the Gradient-based manipulability controls on a pair of simulated 3-link planar manipulators.

The simulation follows the example code in /examples/Tracking/ManipulabilityTrackingDualArmSystem.m of the directory https://github.com/NoemieJaquier/Manipulability.

To run the simulation, clone this repository and extract it to the root directory of the repository https://github.com/NoemieJaquier/Manipulability.
